# Worldle Archive

The goal of the geography puzzle [Worldle](https://worldle.teuteuf.fr) by
@teuteuf is to name a country in six or less guesses given only its outline.
I really enjoy playing it, but it lacks a way to play ones I've missed.

Until @teuteuf includes a way to play previous days' puzzles, you can use the
[Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/) to
play older ones. However, it's missing a number of puzzles prior to Feb 6, 2022.

Have fun playing!
